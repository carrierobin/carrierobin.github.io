# Class Project One
Class project due June 29

I have spent the last 6 years doing extensive reporting on the dialysis industry. The U.S. government has gathered a treasure trove of publicly accessible data on the quality of dialysis care, the number of patients treated, and more. This project is my beginning attempt to dive more deeply into this data to learn about inequalities and disparities in dialysis care in America.

Most of my data was from the files archived at the Dialysis Facility Compare website at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). That enabled me to map the location of every dialysis facility currently operating, as well as map quality metrics, patient mortality rates, and clinics that have opened or closed since 2020.

The data was (relatively) clean, so most of my work was in geocoding the available data. The Jupyter notebooks contain the code I used to wrestle everything into usable format.

This first project is my quest to get more familiar with the datasets and working with them using Pandas, as well as share some high-level descriptive statistics about the industry. Next, I want to integrate Census data to examine clinic quality and how it relates to patient demographics, as well as what we know about the qualities of clinics where patients have been kicked out.
